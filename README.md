# ConArtist

Do you find yourself selling art at conventions often? Do you get home after a
long weekend and just want to relax, but can't because you have to do inventory?
Do you count up all your sales twice and get different results each time?

and no more math, because it's all done automatically!

    (everyone loves graphs when you don't have to make them!)

# Open source

So like, it's open source now. I kept this private for a while but turns out its
a big project for I'll open it to the public! Maybe I'll bring it private again
when it starts to be worth money, but TBH I'll probably keep it open source in
case someone wants to help me (please help me).

Any PR is appreciated. Feel free to tackle any `TODO: ` that is listed in the
code, or pick up one of the issues/project items. If none of those are of
interest but you still want to help, let me know and I'll find something to do.
