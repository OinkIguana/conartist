# ConArtist Shared Assets

Contains all data that is shared between all clients. Though they don't necessarily actually *read*
the data from these files, this is the central source of truth for any value that is to be shared.

## Colors

Colors are stored in integer and string format. The string is `#AARRGGBB`, and the integer is just
the hex value of that.

## Logo

The ConArtist logo, sized to all the sizes required for the different platforms.
