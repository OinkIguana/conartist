## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permissible by law, in no event will ConArtist, its employees, or content

third part, together with any amounts payable to the third part whether in settlement or as may
otherwise be awarded, and reasonable legal costs incurred by any of the Indeminified Parties,
arising from or relating to your use of our Services, and any alleged violation by you of any
applicable law or regulation. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive
defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, but doing so will not excuse
your indemnity obligations.

## Choice of Law and Forum

Where permitted by law, our Terms of Service are governed by and will be interpreted in accordance
with the laws of the Province of Ontario and of the laws of Canada applicable therein, without
regard to any principles of conflicts of law. Where permitted by law, you agree that any action to

further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts for the purpose of any
proceeding arising out of these Terms of Service and waive any objections and defenses inconsistent
with such venue. By using our Services, you represent and warrant that your use complies with
applicable law in your jurisdiction of residence.

## Entire Agreement

These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to your use
of our Services. If any provision of these Terms of Service is held to be invalid or unenforceable,
such provision will be stricken and the remaining provisions enforced. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of these Terms of Service, any provision of these Terms of Service that imposes or
contemplates continuing rights or obligations on you or us will survive the expiration or
termination of these Terms of Service, including, without limitation, the indemnification and
limitation of liability provisions.

It is the express wish of the parties that this agreement and all related documents be drawn up in
English. C’est la volonté expresse des parties que la présente convention ainsi que les documents
qui s’y rattachent soient rédigés en anglais.

The failure of either you or ConArtist to exercise any right provided for in these Terms of Service
in any way won’t be deemed a waiver of any other rights.

These Terms are personal to you. You can’t assign them, transfer them, or sublicense them unless you
get ConArtist's prior written consent. ConArtist has the right to assign, transfer, or delegate any
of its rights and obligations under these Terms of Service without your consent. ConArtist will
provide you notice via email, written notice, or by conspicuously posting the notice on our Site.
