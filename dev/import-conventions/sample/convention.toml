# Hey, thanks for checking out this form! You taking the time to fill this out when requesting a con
# is a huge help! Here's how it goes:

# First, some basic information about the con (REQUIRED)
title = "Super Convention"
# Dates are in "YYYY-MM-DD" format
start_date = 2018-12-08
end_date = 2018-12-10
# Tags won't show up anywhere, but they might someday be used for searching. Put a few in here that
# can describe this con! Don't worry too much about these. Add or remove as many as you like.
tags = ["anime", "furry", "comic", "horror", "sports"]

# The (OPTIONAL) predecessor is a reference to a previous year's version of this convention. Since
# it's the first year of ConArtist it's unlikely you'll need this now, but if you do happen to be
# adding a second edition of something, then this number comes from the ConArtist URL for that con:
#
# Example:
# https://conartist.app/convention/189/details
#                                  ^ here
#predecessor = 189

# Hours are OPTIONAL, but nice to have if you can find it!
# It's most useful if these hours correspond to the times that you'll be selling for.

# Each [[hours]] section corresponds to one day's hours. They should be in order of date!
# Just keep adding more [[hours]] sections for more days' worth of hours.

# The format for these is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS-TimeZone
# (or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+TimeZone if the con's time zone is positive)
