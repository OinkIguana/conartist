# ConArtist Promotional Site

The promo site is barely even started. If someone wants to do it go ahead. It should be as static as
possible, but look super pretty and fancy. It kind of needs screenshots of the app is why it's being
postponed.

## Setup instructions

1.  Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and NPM installed. Just use the latest
    version of both.
2.  Install the dependencies with `npm install`
3.  Build and watch the app with `webpack --watch`
