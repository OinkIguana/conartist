/**
 The `Model` class defines the data model of the entire ConArtist app. At any point, a serialization
 of the model should be able to reproduce (essentially) the same application state.
 
 Externally, the core date of the model appears immutable, and must be updated using the provided
 update functions. This gives the illusion that this works similar to a state store, such as in Flux.
 
 Less 'core' data, such as which items are currently focused, are exposed mutably for the sake of 
 simplicity.
