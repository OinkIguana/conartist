# ConArtist Android App

The Android project was created for an old version of the server, and has since become very
outdated. Go ahead and replace as much or as little of the existing project as you like. Try and
keep the architecture at least *somewhat* similar to the iOS architecture.

## Setup instructions

1.  Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). Get the latest
    versions
2.  Not really sure what to do next. Follow the instructions I guess. Open the project in Android
    Studio. Make some AVDs.
3.  Done?!?

## Designs

For now just go based on the [iOS designs](https://www.figma.com/file/gARds2JGbWtGTY8PJBO5NEJf/ConArtist-iOS).
It would be nice to get an actual Android copy of this, but I don't know what Android apps look like
so I didn't do it. Feel free to start the Android design guide.
